First project: Star Wars themed Space Invaders browser game built with Vanilla Javascript.

# Star Wars Invaders

Space Invaders is a Japanese shooting video game released in 1978 by Taito. It was developed by Tomohiro Nishikado, who was inspired by other media: Breakout, The War of the Worlds, and Star Wars. This game, in turn, is star wars themed, paying homage to this classic game.
